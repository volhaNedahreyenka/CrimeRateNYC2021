# CrimeRateNYC2021

This project I have done in collaboration with Gary Fajardo, Abraham Abdullah and Jasmina Uka as a part of my course work in COOP. 


Dataset: 

The name of the dataset is NYPD_Arrest_Data__Year_to_Date. This dataset includes data about all the arrests in NYC in 2021. The dataset has the information about arrest date, offence description, level of offense, arrest borough, arrest precinct, perpetrator's age, race and sex group, geographic coordinates of crimes. 

  

Summary of Findings: 

During the project my teammates and I found out that the majority of arrested people in 2021 in NYC were black males in the age group 25-44, who originate from low-income and high crime neighborhoods with the majority of inhabitants being people of color. From the data that we analyzed, we concluded that arrests in NYC of 2021 were influenced by location, time, race, age, sex.   


Recommendations for the client  

- To allocate funds for education and social work for the poor neighborhoods to reduce the number of arrests of people of color. 

- To invest money in education and training programs for those who went to jail before such as job fairs. 

- To increase the police presence and run a campaign to bring awareness to robberies (ie. leaflets and advertising billboards) around tourist areas. 

- To increase police presence in the areas with multiple bars and restaurants to prevent crimes under the influence of alcohol. 

- Provide more funding to precincts in boroughs that have more crime and combat overcrowding by opening more precincts. 

- Provide additional training to police officers.
